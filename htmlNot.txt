explanation of simple HTML document -> 
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
  - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
  - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
  - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

- HTML element -> An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag
- point -> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

- colors in HTML -> RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values
  - RGB color format -> combination of Red,Green,Blue  -> rgb(red, green, blue) -> intensity of the color -> value between 0 and 255.
  - HEX format -> #9947bb -> #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue)
  - HSL ->
  - RGBA FORMAT -> add an Alpha channel to the color 
  - HSLA -> add an Alpha channel to the color 

- The alpha channel specifies to opacity of a ( <color> ) 

- RGB -> rgb(255,0,0) 
- RGB -> rgb(0,255,0) 
- RGB -> rgb(0,0,255) 
- RGB -> rgb(255,255,0) 
- RGB -> rgb(255,255,255)

- rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) ->
  - alpha -> 
    - 0 maximum transparency 
    - 1 minimum transparency 

- Hex -> rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255) ->
  -  #9947bb 
  -  #cc90bb 
  -  #47bb60 
  -  #99eebb 
  -  #ee4760

  - Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
  - Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. -> 
    - described as the intensity of a color.
  - Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.
    - described as how much light you want to give the color 

- hsl -> 
  -  hsl(120, 50%, 75%) 
  -  hsl(0, 100%, 30%) 
  -  hsl(0, 50%, 90%) 
  -  hsl(240, 60%, 75%) 
  -  hsl(120, 30%, 60%) 
  -  hsl(240, 50%, 40%) 
  -  hsla(180, 40%, 60%, 0.5) 

- Shades of gray  -> 
  - hue -> 0 
  - saturation -> 0% 
  - lightness -> 0-100% -> darker-lighter 

- hsla -> HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color
  - hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
  -  hsla(0, 0.00%, 50.20%, 0.38) 


- CSS -> stands for cascading style sheet -> to format the layout of a webpage
